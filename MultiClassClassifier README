Hi Everyone !
I am so happy to share this project with you guys
that is Multiclass-Classification using TFIDF-Vectorizer amd
Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier

1st Block:
Importing the all important libraries from sklearn and nltk

#############
Let's analyse the input file sentiment analysis :
It contains many columns but we will stick to the comment 
column to find the sentiment of our sentence.

comment --contains text as well as punctuations.
So it's better to remove the punctuations by including them in the stopwords
and our o/p variable is a categoriacl variable we will split that also

######################
Let us break the categorial o/p variables and assign some value to it.
Here we are using the Regexptokenizer that will split acc to the words and 
it will take the words taht are greater than len 2 and will not take the
stopwords and we have named it as tokenizefunc

########################3

Next we have splitted our data into train and test sets, we can change the type to int if our o/ps 
are in str format.

############################

here I have used TfidfVectorizer fn so that it should not give weightage to 
the words repeating again and again.
PARAMETERS--->stop words and add tokenising fn.
First we intialised tfidf vectorizer with ceratin parmeters and now we will fit_transform the training data 
and transform the  test data.
After fitting the vectorizer ------------>
###############################

Now we will now initialise our MultiNomial Naive Bayes Classifier
We will fit it
We will predict
and calculate the accuracy ========

###############################
Same thing you can do with ANN

ENJOY LEARNING !
